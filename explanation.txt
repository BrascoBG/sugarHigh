* First I made a copy of the existing array.
* I'm sorting the array.
* Declaring variable "sum" where I gonna add values until "sum" hits the threshold's value.
* Declaring an empty array.
* I'm doing the constraints. (other method was to make a function where to add all kind of errors and call them when I need to in sugarHigh() ).
* Going through the sorted array with .length.
* Adding to sum every element until sum < threshold.
* In the "if statement" I declared a variable where I put the indexes of these elements from the original array.
* Then I pushed those indexes to the empty array.
* At last I'm sorting and printing the empty array which is not empty anymore :)
